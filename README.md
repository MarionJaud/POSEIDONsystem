# POSEIDONsystem
Low-Tech and Low-Cost System for High-Resolution Underwater RTK Photogrammetry in Coastal Shallow Waters

We propose here a low-cost (about USD 1500), adaptable, lightweight and easily dismantled system 
called POSEIDON (for Platform Operating in Shallow-water Environment for Imaging and 3D reconstructiON). 
This prototype combines a floating support (typically a bodyboard), two imagery sensors (here, GoPro® 
cameras) and an accurate positioning system using Real Time Kinematic GNSS. Validation of this method 
was deployed in a macrotidal zone, comparing on the foreshore the point cloud provided by POSEIDON 
“SfM bathymetry” and by classical terrestrial SfM survey. Mean deviation was 5.2 cm and standard 
deviation was 4.6 cm. Such high-resolution SfM bathymetric surveys have a great potential for a wide 
range of applications: micro-bathymetry, hydrodynamics (bottom roughness), benthic habitats, ecological 
inventories, archaeology, etc.
